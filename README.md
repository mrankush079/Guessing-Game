🎯 Guessing Game
A fun and interactive number guessing game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project demonstrates DOM manipulation, user feedback, dark mode toggling, and celebratory animations — all wrapped in a clean, responsive UI.

🧠 How It Works
- The user enters a maximum number to define the guessing range.
- A random number is generated between 1 and the max.
- The user guesses until they get it right — with hints after each attempt.
- A confetti animation celebrates the correct guess.
- Tracks number of attempts and offers a Play Again button
